# FoodDeliveryApp
I have Developed a Food Delivery App for a local restaurant with Google API implementation.

LOGIN:
I have used Google API and Firebase for sign of user using their google accounts and firebase to connect to the google database.this joins the app to world pool of Google users which is anyday better than using a local server basd database.

MENU:
I have used Spinner to select between Coffee and Sides. Selecting an element in the list puts it into the selected item list along with its price.

PAYMENT:
I have ANDROID PAY API along with firebase for facilitating the payments. Also, the user has been provided with the options to switch to the options like PayPal and Paytm.

To enhance design and provide a inner view of what the restaturant provides, I have use a slider of images in one of the activity from where the user can switch to the menu!
